A sporadically updated log on what's keeping me busy. Inspired by the [Now page movement](https://nownownow.com) started by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs). My entry lives [here](https://nownownow.com/p/Gh39).

## Work

I'm working my 9-to-5 as an accountant in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Most of my days involve spreadsheets and financial reports. Outside of that, I'm continuing to build [SIPD-RI Helper](https://github.com/odhyp/sipd-ri), a tool to automate repetitive tasks on the [SIPD-RI](https://sipd.kemendagri.go.id/) web application.

## Tech

Lately, I've been experimenting with:

- **Astro** - moving away from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- **Streamlit** - building lightweight internal dashboards
- **Flask** - building simple, useful websites

## Reading

I don't read as much as I'd like, but I keep a few articles bookmarked.
