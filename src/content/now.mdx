## Work

I'm working my 9-to-5 as an accountant in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Most of my days involve spreadsheets and financial reports. Outside of that, I'm continuing to build [SIPD-RI Helper](https://github.com/odhyp/sipd-ri), a tool to automate repetitive tasks on the [SIPD-RI](https://sipd.kemendagri.go.id/) web application.

## Interests

Lately, I've been experimenting with:

- **Astro** - moving away from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- **Streamlit** - building lightweight internal dashboards
- **Flask** - building simple, useful websites
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) - creating charts for data visualization
