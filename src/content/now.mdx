## Work

I'm working my 9-to-5 as an accountant in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Most of my days involve spreadsheets and financial reports.

## Interests

Lately, I've been experimenting with:

- Learning [Astro](https://astro.build/), moving away from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Building lightweight internal dashboards with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- Creating charts for data visualization using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/)

## Ideas & Plans

- Implementing [astro-og-canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-og-canvas) to automatically generate OpenGraph images for this site
- Reviving my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/odhypradhana) account by creating datasets. I'm planning to do the data visualization part in this site as well
