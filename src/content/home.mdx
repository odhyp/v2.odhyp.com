Hello, I'm Odhy. I'm an accountant, developer, artist, and digital gardener.

This is my personal website where I share what I'm exploring and keep track of projects and experiments along the way.

## Writings

My digital garden is where I explore ideas in progress, document what I'm learning along the way, and create a trail of thoughts and notes I can return to, refine, and grow over time.

## Projects

I enjoy building small tools, experiments, and side projects. I'm also diving deeper into data science, focusing on visualization and data storytelling. This space is both a portfolio and a playground.
