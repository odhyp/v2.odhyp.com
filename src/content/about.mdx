Hello, I'm **Odhy Pradhana**. I like creating simple, useful apps, building websites for fun, and telling stories with charts.

I write to share what I've learned and what I'm building, like working on a project with the garage door open. It helps me trace where I've been and how I got here. It's part reference, part reflection.

I also enjoy audio experiments, especially acoustic music and ambient noises. I play guitar and piano, while trying my best not to sing.

Outside of that, I love quiet walks in nature, visiting beaches, and spending time with my wife and our two cats.

This site is my corner of the web, but I'd love for it to be a conversation. If you want to share an idea, talk about something I've written, or just say hello, you can reach me at [hello@odhyp.com](mailto:hello@odhyp.com).
