Hello, I'm Odhy Pradhana.

I like creating simple and useful apps, build websites for fun, and [telling stories with charts]().

My interest in computers started when I was a kid, after my parents bought a Windows XP PC. I spent time playing Pokémon on a GameBoy Advance emulator and experimenting with Excel spreadsheets to calculate stats and builds. Later, I learned C in high school as part of Informatics Olympiad training. During 2020, I picked up Python and web development through online tutorials and built my first website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator written in Ruby. I still enjoy exploring programming, especially Python and the web.

I also enjoy doing [audio experiments](), especially acoustic music and ambient noises. I play guitar and piano, while trying my best to sing.
