My name is Odhy Pradhana. I'm from Malang, Indonesia. This site is where I keep track of my work, projects, and interests.

### Accountant

I studied accounting at [Polytechnic of State Finance STAN](https://pknstan.ac.id/), where I earned an Associate Degree. I currently work as a Civil Servant in Indonesia's Regional Government while pursuing a Bachelor Degree at [Universitas Terbuka](https://www.ut.ac.id/).

### Developer

My interest in computers started when I was a kid, after my parents bought a Windows XP PC. I spent time playing Pokémon on a GameBoy Advance emulator and experimenting with Excel spreadsheets to calculate stats and builds. Later, I learned C in high school as part of Informatics Olympiad training. During 2020, I picked up Python and web development through online tutorials and built my first website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in Ruby. I still enjoy exploring programming, especially Python and the web.

### Artist

In college, a friend introduced me to the guitar. That led me to experiment with audio production in [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/) and later teach myself keyboard. Music has been a creative project that I continue to explore at my own pace, especially experimenting with ambient textures.

### Digital Gardener

I first encountered the term _digital garden_ in [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) by Maggie Appleton. I have always enjoyed writing down ideas, strategies, and notes for both games and projects, but most of them ended up scattered across notepads, Word files, and apps like Notion or Google Keep. This site is my way to organize and share them, piece by piece, in a space that can grow over time.
