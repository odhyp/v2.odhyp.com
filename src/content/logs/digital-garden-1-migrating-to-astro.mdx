After working with Hugo for my personal website since April 2024, I've decided to let it go. Over the past few days, I started learning Astro and ended up migrating everything. Both are static site generators, so why switch? The truth is I have always disliked JavaScript, but if you work in web development you can't avoid it. I chose to embrace it.

I was actually looking for a new framework to build my business website. My first pick was Next.js, mostly because there are plenty of tutorials available and a friend recommended it. Before I got very far, I came across Astro in [an article by CloudCannon about static site generators](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/the-top-five-static-site-generators-for-2025-and-when-to-use-them/). The feature that caught my attention was partial hydration, also known as the island architecture. It avoids shipping a large JavaScript bundle while still letting you use JavaScript components, so your site can remain static and lightweight.

Astro also allows integration with frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte. I don't plan to use them all, but having JavaScript available when building dynamic content is important.

After experimenting with Astro on a few projects, I asked myself: why not rebuild my personal website with it? So here we are.
