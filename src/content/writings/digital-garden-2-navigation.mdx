import Wrapper from "../../components/page/Wrapper.astro";
import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import { Icon } from "astro-icon/components";

I experimented with several navbar styles for this site, from the basic one like my [old site](https://v1.odhyp.com/) to sidebars, static or sticky bars, and dropdowns. I want something non-distracting for this digital garden labyrinth.

import pic1 from "../../assets/images/v1-website.png";

<Wrapper class="bleed space-y-0 text-center text-sm">
  <Image
    src={pic1}
    alt="My old website landing page"
    title="My old website landing page"
    format="webp"
    quality="mid"
    class="border border-neutral-200 shadow-lg"
  />
  [My old site](https://v1.odhyp.com) navigation
</Wrapper>

This is the most common, bread-and-butter header/navbar. Since the site is only 600px wide, I want another approach for the navigation. Beside that, I'm also a bit bored with this basic navigation style.

## Trying out the most "Essentialist" style

import pic2 from "../../assets/images/digital-garden-2-maxime.png";

<Wrapper class="bleed">
  <Image
    src={pic2}
    alt="Maxime Vaillancourt home page"
    title="Maxime Vaillancourt home page"
    format="webp"
    quality="mid"
    class="border border-neutral-200 shadow-lg"
  />
</Wrapper>

[Maxime's](https://maximevaillancourt.com/) website is peak essentialism. Focus only on what's _necessary_ and remove everything that doesn't contribute to the main purpose. Which in this case, blogging.

Sadly, I can't implement his style (_I've tried..._) for this site since I have categorization. I have [writings](/writings) and [projects](/projects) page, which is completely different. I have a non-blog page like [now](/now), [about](/about), and [guestbook](/guestbook) which I can't display alongside blog pages. I have to put it in a different place, a menu or navigation.

## Archive-like approach

import pic3 from "../../assets/images/digital-garden-2-manuel-home-page.jpeg";
import pic4 from "../../assets/images/digital-garden-2-manuel-navigation.jpeg";

<Wrapper class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-2 sm:gap-x-4 md:gap-x-8">

<Wrapper class="space-y-0 text-center text-sm">
  <Image
    src={pic3}
    alt=""
    title=""
    format="webp"
    quality="mid"
    class="border border-neutral-200 shadow-lg"
  />
  Blog page
</Wrapper>

<Wrapper class="space-y-0 text-center text-sm">
  <Image
    src={pic4}
    alt=""
    title=""
    format="webp"
    quality="mid"
    class="border border-neutral-200 shadow-lg"
  />
  Navigation, after page content
</Wrapper>

</Wrapper>

[Manu's](https://manuelmoreale.com/) website is unique, it's _headerless_. Once you visit the home page, you will be greeted by his latest blog post content. After reading the post, voila! There's a navigation links underneath it, right under "**What should you do next?**". It's wrapped in a paragraph, descriptive style, which is a cool approach.

## Card component

Manu's navigation style reminds me when I'm working with Table Of Contents in Microsoft Word. You have a heading title with a page number in the right-most side, with dots in the middle that connect and guide the viewers eye.

With that in mind, I created a `<Card>` component:

<Wrapper class="@container rounded-md border border-neutral-200 px-4 py-2 md:px-8">
  <div class="group flex flex-row items-baseline justify-between gap-x-2 gap-y-1 py-1">
    <span class="shrink-0 font-medium transition-colors duration-200 ease-in-out group-hover:text-red-800 group-hover:underline group-hover:underline-offset-2">
      Example Title
    </span>
    <div class="w-full border-b border-dashed text-neutral-300 transition-colors duration-200 ease-in-out group-hover:text-neutral-500"></div>
    <span class="shrink-0 text-sm text-neutral-500 transition-colors duration-200 ease-in-out group-hover:text-neutral-700">
      A week ago
    </span>
  </div>
</Wrapper>

In mobile, I use a column layout using `flex-col` for my current writings and projects card.

- TODO: explain that it's the same (mobile and desktop) layout for the above example

## Menu component

I've created a `<Menu>` component to show a navigation link along with an icon and short description.

<Wrapper class="">asd</Wrapper>

I can easily integrate them in the page without looking like a [regular anchor tag](#custom-menu-component). You can distinguish them from the basic text from the icon, which indicates that it is a menu which will lead you to other pages.
