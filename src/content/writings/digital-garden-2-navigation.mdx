I experimented with several navbar styles for this site, from the basic one like my [old site](https://v1.odhyp.com/) to sidebars, static or sticky bars, and dropdowns. I want something non-distracting for this digital garden labyrinth.

- [ ] Show experimentation with navigation: sidebar, sticky/static, dropdowns, etc
- [ ] Explain intent and approach
- [ ] Show final navigation with Breadcrumbs
- [ ] Show menu component
- [ ] Show social component
