This site collects minimal data. Just enough to understand what's working and to improve your experience.

## Analytics

- I use **Google Analytics** to see metrics like page views, device type, and general location.
- Data is aggregated and does not personally identify you.
- Google Analytics may use cookies or IP addresses (anonymized where possible) to provide these insights.

You can adjust or block cookies in your browser settings if you prefer.

## Comments

- This site uses [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for comments and discussions.
- Giscus is powered by **GitHub Discussions**. Posting a comment requires a GitHub account, and your comments are public on GitHub.
- Comments are not stored on this site. They are managed by GitHub and saved in this [repository](https://github.com/odhyp/odhyp/discussions) discussion.

## No Ads or Trackers

This site does not:

- Show ads
- Use tracking pixels
- Sell or share your data
- Collect unnecessary personal information

## Your Privacy, Your Control

You can browse the site without logging in, signing up, or sharing personal details. Any interaction beyond reading (like leaving a comment) is entirely optional.
