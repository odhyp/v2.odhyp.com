I designed and built this site myself. Everything is open source and published on Github if you'd like to poke around. The whole thing is frankly overengineered for a personal website, but playing with transient web technologies is an indulgent hobby I don't want to relinquish. I started building it in late 2021 and tinker on it regularly.
