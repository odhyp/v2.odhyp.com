# Notes

1. I made Cloudflare R2 Object Storage bucket named `media`, with a custom domain of `media.odhyp.com`. It's for hosting all media files like PDF and Excel files for data visualization, or high-quality images that doesn't need to be compressed using Astro's Image component. We may extend/add this to store `/gallery` images.
